<h3 style="color:black"><center>The reason for this websites existsence is to help young people between the ages 18 to 25 years old to get out of the house and experience their local green spaces in Manchester.<br>This is because I believe that young people today don't go outside enough and experience the world around them.<br> Hopefully with this website I will be able to persuade people to go outside and venture to their nearby green spaces.</center></h3>

<h2 style="color:black"><center>The reason for this website.</center></h2>
<h3 style="color:black"><center>The reason for this websites existence is to help young people between the ages 18 to 25 years old to get out of the house and experience their local green spaces in Manchester.<br>This is because I believe that young people today don't go outside enough and experience the world around them.<br> Hopefully with this website I will be able to persuade people to go outside and venture to their nearby green spaces.</center></h3>
<h2 style="color:black"><center>What are the benefits of going outside?</center></h2>
<h3 style="color:black"><center>There are mutliple benefits to going outside.<br>The first benefits are physical benefits, the first benefit is lower blood pressure which can prevent heart disease and strokes.<br> It also decreases cholesterol levels which can prevent cardiovascular risks which is also preventing heart disease, strokes and the need to have surgery to fix these issues.<br>There are also mental health benefits, it can help bolster your mood and lower stress levels.<br> Being in green spaces boosts serotonin and dopamine levels which contributes to happiness and reduces feelings of anger, anxiety and frustration.  </center>
